Hi! I'm Thomas Rynsburger.

00:02.001 --> 00:06.366
I am currently a 2nd year Computer Information Systems student.

00:06.396 --> 00:10.032
One of my hobbies is playing the piano and my trumpet,

00:10.032 --> 00:13.365
especially pretending like I know how to play jazz.

00:13.365 --> 00:14.531
I also like reading.

00:14.531 --> 00:19.030
I recently finished rereading Fahrenheit 451 with my friends

00:19.030 --> 00:23.429
and I'm hoping to get through the rest of this guy

00:23.429 --> 00:25.872
over christmas break.

00:25.872 --> 00:28.992
I also like to play and program games in my spare time.

00:28.992 --> 00:33.791
I participated in my first Hackathon this last October.

00:33.791 --> 00:37.644
My teammates and I made a game and we won 2nd place with it,

00:37.644 --> 00:39.631
so, that's really cool.

00:39.631 --> 00:41.486
I also like to draw.

00:41.486 --> 00:43.202
Some traditional, pen and paper,

00:43.202 --> 00:46.096
but also plenty digital as well.

00:46.096 --> 00:49.086
I personally really like drawing pixel art,

00:49.086 --> 00:52.024
but I dabble in some other mediums as well.

00:52.024 --> 00:53.341
But in any case,

00:53.341 --> 00:55.129
thank you for dropping by my website!

00:55.129 --> 00:55.991
Take care :)
